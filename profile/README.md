## Our Mission

3CD: Curate, Clean & Centralize African Data

To democratize access to African data by creating a centralized, open platform where datasets can be discovered, shared, and utilized for research, innovation, and policy-making.

We believe that data sovereignty and accessibility are crucial for Africa's development and representation in the global data landscape.

We envision a future where African data is not only accessible but also actively contributing to global research, innovation, and policy development.
